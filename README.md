# Examples
## Getting a specific user from the json file.
### step: 1

In this example we will use curl to make our requests, you could as well use httpie or use a different client like postman.

Run the following command to get your bearer token.

```bash
$ BearerToken=$(curl -s -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"username":"david","password":"save"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/|python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access'])")

```
### step: 2
make a request to the database using the Bearer token from the above step.

```bash
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/1/;echo ""

```

## Getting all the users from a json file.

Use the previously generated bearer token to make your requests.

```bash
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/;echo ""
```

## Getting a specific user from a json file.
```bash
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/1/;echo ""

```
## Adding a user to the json file.
Note that this method on success will return the id of the newly added
when making the request set the id to any value but the api will overrite your value to a new id based on existing ids this is due to json limitations unlike if a database system was in use.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "id": -1,
    "firstname": "Ambitious",
    "lastname": "Johnson",
    "phone_number": "0713434342",
    "occupation": "teacher",
    "nationality": "Kenyan",
    "age": 30,
    "loan_limit": "ksh.200"
}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/ ; echo""

```
## Getting all the loans from the json file.
```bash
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/loans/;echo ""
```

## Getting a specific loan from the json file.
```bash
$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/loans/1/;echo ""


```
### Adding a loan to the json file
The id is generated by the api but we set it temporarily to -1 due to json limitations, on success the id of the newly added user will be returned
```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BearerToken}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "id": -1,
            "user_id": 3,
            "loan_amount": "ksh.300",
            "days": 30,
            "loan_status": "npl"
}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/loans/ ; echo""

```
